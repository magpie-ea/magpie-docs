They can provide a welcome message, instructions or collect post-survey data. The most important wrapping view is the thanks view. The thanks view must always be included in your experiment because it wraps up and processes the data collected during the experiment. All wrapping views have two obligatory fields : trials: int - the number of trials this view will appear name: string - the name of the view Different types of wrapping views have more optional fields, as documented below.

They usually collect the data and often rely on additional information (e.g., the picture to be displayed in trial 27, or the question and answer options for trial 13). Forced-choice task Instantiate with babeView.forcedChoice . Displays a context, a picture and a question to be answered in a two-alternative forced choice task. Choices are made by clicking on one of two buttons. Obligatory Fields option1: string - text on button for option 1 option2: string - text on button for option 2 Optional Fields question: string - question to be asked QUD: string - text that is always present on the slide canvas: object - more about babe canvas picture: string (link) - picture to be displayed Sample data const forced_choice_trials = [ { picture: \"path/to/picture_of_questionmark.jpg\", question: \"What's the weather like? like?\", option1: \"shiny\", option2: \"rainbow\" } ]; Sentence Choice task Instantiate with babeViews.sentenceChoice .

For Heroku deployment, you may do so by running heroku open in the command line or find the app URL in your Heroku account. For local deployment, the URL is by default http://localhost:4000. The server app shows a list of experiments whose data may be stored in a database. It shows the experiments ID, its name, its author, the number of submissions retrieved so far, date information, as well as whether the experiment is currently active or not. If an experiment is set to be active, it allows further submissions to be recorded in the database. The server app allows you to retrieve the data for an experiment from the database. Simply click on the button \"Retrieve CSV\" to download a CSV-file with the data collected so far. To delete an experiment, click the \"Delete\" button. Always make sure that you have recovered all necessary data from that experiment; otherwise your data collected so far might be irrevocably lost. You can also edit an experiment with the \"Edit\" button. You can change information about the experiment on the edit-screen. You can also toggle whether the experiment is active or not. You can set a maximum number of submissions after which the experiment automatically toggles its activity status off. Any submission made by a participant to a non-active experiment is just lost and will not be recorded. This is to protect your database from pollution or attacks, but if used unwisely could also cause you loss of relevant data. Finally, the server app allows you to create and manage new experiments. Click on the \"New\" button to do this. The interface for creating a new experiment is parallel to editing an existing experiment. Importantly, you need to give some required information about a new experiment (name and author). If you want to use dynamic retrieval of experiment data (documented here ), you must specify which fields should be available to be retrieved by your API calls.
